NUMBER GUESSING GAME

The fun and easy project “Guess the Number” is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:

 1.The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.

 2.The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.

 3.The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.

 4.The game continues under the user guessing the number.

You can also incorporate further details as:

 ->Limiting the number of attempts.

 ->Adding more rounds.

 ->Displaying score.

 ->Giving points based on the number of attempts.
